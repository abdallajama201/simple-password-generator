# 03 JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator
 
## Description
 
This project is a single page website that allows a user to generate a random password of a specific length and with various character types.

Users can generate passwords to replace their current ones from time to time. An additional feature of the webpage is that users can choose to include special characters, numbers and letters in both upper and lower case. This allows users to generate very strong passwords that may be required in some cases. Users can also exclude character types in order to generate a weaker password that may be easier to remember.
